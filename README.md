In this project, we analyze the PhysioNet Sleep-EDF Database in order to develop a classification model of sleep stages. The successful development of this model will help patients and doctors get more accurate sleep recordings which in response can be used as both a detective and preventative method against diseases such as Alzheimers.

Sleep Cassette Study Data Overview
Our study focused primarily on 153 Sleep Cassette (SC) files that were obtained in a 1987-1991 study of age effects on sleep in healthy Caucasians aged 25-101, without any sleep-related medication. A complete overview of the dataset and the original study can be found at this link: https://www.physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/
